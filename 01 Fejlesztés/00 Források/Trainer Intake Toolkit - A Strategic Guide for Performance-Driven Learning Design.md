## **Introduction: A Strategic Framework for Training Intake**

The process of initiating a new training project is the single most critical phase in the learning and development (L\&D) lifecycle. Traditionally viewed as an administrative step—a simple matter of receiving a request and gathering content—the intake process is, in fact, a strategic diagnostic engagement. Its quality and rigor directly determine the ultimate effectiveness, business impact, and return on investment (ROI) of the final learning solution. Missteps at this stage inevitably lead to misaligned, ineffective, and costly training initiatives that fail to solve the underlying performance problems they were intended to address.

This toolkit reframes the intake process from a passive "order-taking" function to an active, strategic "performance consulting" engagement. It provides L\&D professionals with a comprehensive suite of instruments designed to systematically diagnose business needs, define measurable outcomes, and ensure that every element of a learning solution is purposefully aligned with organizational goals. The core principle guiding this toolkit is the establishment of a **"golden thread"**—an unbroken, evidence-based line of sight that connects high-level business objectives to the specific on-the-job behaviors required of learners, the competencies that enable those behaviors, the learning objectives that build those competencies, the assessments that measure them, and the metrics that prove their impact.1

### **How to Use This Toolkit**

This toolkit is designed as a modular, sequential guide for L\&D professionals to use when a new training request is received. The recommended workflow is as follows:

1. **Deploy the Strategic Screener (Part 1):** Upon receiving a training request, use the 5-Minute Diagnostic with the requesting stakeholder. This initial step is crucial for determining if training is the appropriate solution or if the root cause lies in non-training factors such as environment, motivation, or resources.  
2. **Conduct In-Depth Discovery (Parts 2 & 3):** If the screener confirms a knowledge or skill gap, proceed with a full discovery process. The **Master Question Bank** serves as a comprehensive repository for this phase. The **Trainer Intake Survey** can be sent to the Subject Matter Expert (SME) or trainer for asynchronous completion, while the **SME Interview Guide** provides a structure for a deep, synchronous conversation.  
3. **Synthesize and Align (Part 4):** Use the **Strategic Alignment Mapping Sheet** as a collaborative tool with the SME and key stakeholders. This capstone document synthesizes all the information gathered into a single, coherent plan, creating the "golden thread" that will guide the entire design and development process.  
4. **Tailor and Refine (Part 5):** If the target audience includes a significant number of younger employees, use the **Gen Z & Gen Alpha Add-on** to refine design choices and ensure the learning experience is engaging and effective for this demographic.

By following this structured approach, L\&D teams can transform their intake process into a powerful strategic lever, ensuring that every learning initiative is a targeted, measurable, and value-driven investment in organizational performance.

## **Part 1: The Strategic Screener — Diagnosing the Performance Problem**

The most significant waste in learning and development stems from designing elegant solutions to the wrong problems. Stakeholders, often under pressure to act, frequently diagnose a performance issue and prescribe "training" as the universal remedy.3 However, performance is a complex outcome influenced by multiple factors, and a lack of knowledge or skill is only one possible cause. Environmental barriers, misaligned incentives, or a lack of resources are common root causes that training cannot fix.3

This Strategic Screener is a critical diagnostic tool designed to be deployed at the very first point of contact with a stakeholder. Its purpose is to move beyond the requested solution and uncover the true nature of the performance problem. By asking a short series of targeted questions, the L\&D professional can quickly determine whether the issue is genuinely a training problem or if it requires a different type of intervention.

This diagnostic approach is more than a simple filter; it is a powerful mechanism for building credibility and repositioning the L\&D function. When a stakeholder requests a training course, they are presenting a solution. An L\&D professional who immediately begins discussing the course specifications is acting as an order-taker. In contrast, an L\&D professional who deploys this screener shifts the conversation from "what course should we build?" to "what problem are we trying to solve?".7 This consultative stance demonstrates a primary focus on business results, not just training delivery. By correctly diagnosing the root cause—even if the recommendation is ultimately

*not* a training solution—the L\&D team provides immense value, preventing the misallocation of resources and guiding the stakeholder toward a more effective intervention, such as process improvement or a management coaching plan. This act of expert diagnosis fundamentally elevates the relationship, establishing L\&D as a strategic performance partner for all future engagements.

### **The 5-Minute Diagnostic Questionnaire**

This questionnaire should be administered to the requesting manager or stakeholder to gather initial data on the performance problem.

1. **Business Problem & Success Metrics:**  
   * What is the specific business problem you are trying to solve? (e.g., "Customer complaints are up 20% this quarter.") 7  
   * What does success look like? If this initiative is successful, what specific number or metric will have changed six months from now? (e.g., "Customer complaints will be reduced to their previous level of 5% of all interactions.") 7  
2. **Required On-the-Job Behavior:**  
   * To achieve that success, what, specifically, do you need people to *do* differently on the job? Please use observable action verbs (e.g., "Correctly apply the new three-step de-escalation policy," "Accurately enter customer data into the new CRM system"). Avoid vague terms like "understand" or "be aware of." 4  
3. **Root Cause Analysis:**  
   * Why aren't people doing this correctly now? Please consider the following potential causes:  
     * **Knowledge/Skill Gap:** Is it because they don't know *how* to do it or lack the skill to do it well? Have they ever received clear instructions or training on this specific task before? 3  
     * **Environmental/Resource Barriers:** Do they have the necessary tools, information, time, and authority to perform the task as expected? Is there something in the workflow, system, or physical environment that makes it difficult or impossible? 3  
     * **Motivation/Incentives:** Are the expectations for this task clear? Do they receive regular feedback on their performance? What are the consequences—positive or negative—for performing the task correctly or incorrectly? Are they incentivized to do something else instead? 3  
4. **Previous Interventions:**  
   * What have you already tried to solve this problem? What were the results of those efforts? 7

### **Decision Flowchart: Is Training the Right Solution?**

The answers from the diagnostic questionnaire can be analyzed using the following flowchart to determine the appropriate next steps. This model is adapted from action mapping principles designed to distinguish between different types of performance barriers.5

**START: Analyze the primary answer to Question 3 ("Why aren't they doing it now?").**

* **IF the primary cause is an Environmental or Resource Barrier...**  
  * *(Examples: "The new software is too slow," "They don't have the authority to issue a refund," "The procedure is documented in a 300-page manual they can't access.")*  
  * **Is training required to navigate the barrier?**  
    * **NO:** The solution is not training. **RECOMMENDATION:** Process Improvement, System Enhancement, or Job Aid Development. For example, fix the software, grant the necessary authority, or create a one-page quick reference guide.4  
    * **YES:** The barrier cannot be removed, and people need to be taught a workaround. **RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with a targeted training needs analysis, but clearly state that the training will only address the workaround and that the root-cause barrier remains a business risk.  
* **IF the primary cause is a Motivation or Incentive issue...**  
  * *(Examples: "They don't get any feedback on their performance," "They are rewarded for call volume, not quality," "There are no consequences for doing it incorrectly.")*  
  * **Is the lack of motivation due to a lack of confidence in their ability to perform the task?**  
    * **YES:** A skill gap may be contributing to the motivation issue. **RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with a training needs analysis, but advise the stakeholder that a parallel management intervention (e.g., setting clear expectations, providing feedback) is also required for the training to be effective.5  
    * **NO:** The performers know how to do the task but choose not to. The solution is not training. **RECOMMENDATION:** Management and Coaching Intervention. The manager needs to set clear expectations, provide feedback, and establish appropriate consequences.4  
* **IF the primary cause is a Knowledge or Skill Gap...**  
  * *(Examples: "They have never been shown how to use the new system," "The policy changed last week and no one has been briefed," "They don't know how to handle this type of customer objection.")*  
  * **Could this knowledge be better stored in the environment (e.g., in a checklist, job aid, or system prompt)?**  
    * **YES:** The task is complex or performed infrequently, making a job aid more efficient than memorization. **RECOMMENDATION:** Develop a Job Aid or Performance Support Tool. A brief training session on how to use the job aid may be necessary, but a full course is likely not required.5  
    * **NO:** The skill requires fluent, memorized performance (e.g., a critical safety procedure, a core conversation skill). **RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with a full and comprehensive training needs analysis using the instruments in this toolkit. Training is the appropriate solution.

## **Part 2: The Master Question Bank for Training Discovery**

Once the Strategic Screener has confirmed that a knowledge or skill gap is the root cause of the performance problem, the next step is a comprehensive discovery process. This Master Question Bank serves as the central repository of validated questions to guide this phase. It is organized into eight strategic categories, covering the full spectrum of analysis required to design an effective learning solution. These questions form the basis for the survey and interview instruments in Part 3\.

### **2.1 Defining Business Imperatives & Program Goals**

**Rationale:** This category of questions establishes the "why" behind the training request. It creates a direct and explicit link between the learning initiative and a measurable organizational outcome. By starting with the desired business result (Kirkpatrick Level 4), the entire project is framed in terms of value and impact, making it possible to measure success and calculate ROI later.7 Without this foundational clarity, training can become an activity without a purpose, disconnected from the strategic priorities of the business.

* What is the ideal business outcome you would like to experience as a result of this training? Please describe it in terms of specific, measurable business metrics (e.g., increase sales by 10%, reduce production errors by 15%, improve customer satisfaction scores from 80% to 90%). 7  
* How does this training initiative support the company's broader goals for this year? 12  
* What is the business problem we are trying to solve? Please provide concrete examples of the behavior or skill deficit that is causing this problem. 7  
* If we did nothing and did not proceed with this training, what is the ongoing risk or cost to the business? 7  
* How will we measure our success? What specific data points or reports will we look at in three, six, or twelve months to confirm that this initiative was a success? 7  
* Is this training part of a larger organizational initiative, such as a new product launch, a system implementation, or a change in business strategy? 7  
* How much of an effect do you expect this training to have on the target business metrics? 13  
* Who are the key business stakeholders for this project, and what are their expectations for success? 14

### **2.2 Analyzing the Learner, Context & Constraints**

**Rationale:** Effective learning is, by definition, learner-centered. To design an experience that resonates, engages, and facilitates skill acquisition, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the target audience. This includes their existing knowledge, their professional roles, their motivations, their work environment, and any potential barriers to learning or application.15 These questions are designed to build a detailed learner persona that will inform every design decision, from content selection to activity design and choice of modality.

* **Audience Profile:**  
  * Who is the primary target audience for this training? Please describe their roles, responsibilities, and typical day-to-day tasks. 14  
  * What is the size of the target audience? Are they located in a single office, or are they geographically distributed? 17  
  * What is the range of experience levels within this audience (e.g., new hires, seasoned experts)? 15  
  * Describe the audience's demographics (e.g., age range, cultural background) and any language or accessibility needs we should consider. 14  
* **Prior Knowledge & Experience:**  
  * What is the audience's current level of familiarity with this topic? What prerequisite knowledge or skills can we assume they already possess? 15  
  * Have they received training on this topic before? If so, what did that training cover, and how effective was it? 7  
* **Motivation & Attitudes:**  
  * What are the learners' goals and expectations for this training? What's in it for them? 16  
  * How relevant is this topic to their daily roles? How will mastering this skill make their job easier or more successful? 18  
  * What are their general attitudes toward training? Are they likely to be enthusiastic, skeptical, or indifferent? 3  
  * What are the primary motivators for this audience (e.g., career advancement, recognition, solving a frustrating problem)? 19  
* **Work Context & Environment:**  
  * Describe the environment where these new skills will be applied. Is it fast-paced, high-pressure, collaborative, or independent? 7  
  * Will learners have immediate and frequent opportunities to practice and apply what they've learned? 15  
  * What level of support can learners expect from their direct managers after the training? Will managers be involved in coaching or reinforcement? 15  
  * What tools, systems, and resources do they use in their daily work that are relevant to this topic? 12

### **2.3 Conducting a Content & Expertise Inventory**

**Rationale:** The goal of this section is to precisely define the scope of the learning content. A common failure in training design is the "SME brain dump," where an expert attempts to include everything they know about a subject, overwhelming learners with information that is not critical for job performance.21 These questions are designed to help the SME and L\&D professional collaborate to distinguish between "need-to-know" information (essential for performance) and "nice-to-know" information (supplementary or background context). This ensures the final content is lean, focused, and directly tied to the desired on-the-job behaviors.

* **Core Content & Priorities:**  
  * If a learner could only remember three to five key things from this training one year from now, what should they be? 23  
  * What are the major topics or modules that must be covered to achieve the learning objectives? 14  
  * What specific knowledge, tasks, and skills are absolutely essential for someone to be competent in this area? 23  
  * What information is critical for learners to memorize and recall instantly, versus what can be provided as a job aid or reference guide for on-demand use? 5  
  * What information is "nice-to-know" but not critical for initial proficiency? (This can be offered as optional, supplementary material). 23  
* **Common Challenges & Errors:**  
  * What are the most common mistakes people make when performing these tasks? 23  
  * What are the most dangerous or costly mistakes that can be made? What are their impacts? 23  
  * What parts of this topic or process typically cause the most confusion for new learners? 15  
  * What are the most frequent questions you receive about this topic? 23  
  * What is the gap between the "ideal" way the process should be done and how it is actually done in practice? 23  
* **Real-World Context & Existing Resources:**  
  * Can you provide real-world stories, examples, or case studies that illustrate the key learning points? 22  
  * Are there any existing materials—such as manuals, presentations, videos, checklists, or previous training content—that we can leverage or reference? 13  
  * How effective or ineffective are the existing materials? What works well and what is missing? 13  
  * Are there any industry standards, regulations, or best practices that must be incorporated into the content? 15

### **2.4 Formulating Performance-Based Learning Objectives**

**Rationale:** Learning objectives are the cornerstone of effective instructional design. They are precise, measurable statements that describe what a learner will be able to *do* as a result of the training.24 Vague goals like "learners will understand the new policy" are insufficient because "understand" cannot be directly observed or measured.26 This section provides a framework—the Condition-Behavior-Criterion (CBC) model—to guide the SME in crafting objectives that are clear, actionable, and directly aligned with the desired on-the-job performance. Well-defined objectives serve as a contract for the learning experience and provide the clear criteria needed to design valid assessments.26

#### **Guidance on the CBC Model**

A strong, performance-based learning objective contains three essential components 27:

1. **Condition:** Describes the circumstances, tools, or resources available (or unavailable) to the learner when they are demonstrating the behavior. It answers the question, "Under what conditions?"  
   * *Examples:* "Given a completed customer intake form...", "Using the standard operating procedure manual...", "Without reference to any notes or job aids...".26  
2. **Behavior:** States the specific, observable action the learner will perform. This must be an action verb that can be seen or heard. It answers the question, "What will the learner DO?"  
   * *Examples:* "...the learner will *identify* the three required safety checks," "...the learner will *demonstrate* the proper lifting technique," "...the learner will *write* a two-paragraph summary.".26  
3. **Criterion:** Specifies the standard of acceptable performance. It defines "how well" the behavior must be performed to be considered competent. It answers the question, "To what degree?"  
   * *Examples:* "...with 100% accuracy," "...within 5 minutes," "...including at least three supporting facts.".26

Example of a complete CBC Objective:  
"Given a simulated customer complaint email (Condition), the learner will compose a response (Behavior) that addresses all of the customer's stated issues and adheres to the company's tone-of-voice guidelines (Criterion)."

#### **Key Tool: Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verbs**

To help SMEs select precise, measurable verbs for the "Behavior" component of their objectives, the following table provides a menu of options categorized by the desired level of cognitive complexity, based on Bloom's Taxonomy. This tool is instrumental in moving from vague goals to concrete performance statements, which in turn dictates the design of both learning activities and assessments, ensuring perfect alignment—a core tenet of Backward Design.1

| Bloom's Level | Description | Action Verbs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Remembering** | Recalling facts and basic concepts. | define, list, name, recall, repeat, state, identify, label, recognize, select 30 |
| **Understanding** | Explaining ideas or concepts. | classify, describe, discuss, explain, summarize, paraphrase, interpret, give examples, report 30 |
| **Applying** | Using information in new situations. | apply, demonstrate, implement, solve, use, execute, operate, prepare, schedule, sketch 30 |
| **Analyzing** | Drawing connections among ideas; breaking material into constituent parts. | analyze, compare, contrast, differentiate, organize, examine, test, question, distinguish 30 |
| **Evaluating** | Justifying a stand or decision; appraising or critiquing. | appraise, critique, defend, judge, recommend, support, justify, evaluate, rate, verify 30 |
| **Creating** | Producing new or original work. | compose, design, develop, formulate, construct, create, invent, generate, plan, hypothesize 30 |

### **2.5 Determining Acceptable Evidence of Learning**

**Rationale:** Following the principles of Backward Design, the process of defining how learning will be assessed should occur *before* the content is developed.32 By deciding on the "acceptable evidence" of learning upfront, the instructional design process becomes more focused and efficient. The assessments become the target, and all content and activities are then designed with the express purpose of preparing the learner to succeed on those assessments. This approach ensures tight alignment between objectives, content, and evaluation, and prevents the inclusion of extraneous content that does not contribute to demonstrated competence.1

* For each learning objective we have defined, how will we know if a learner has achieved it? What will they need to produce, say, or do as evidence? 1  
* What does an excellent performance on this task look like? What does an adequate performance look like? What would be considered an unacceptable performance? 32  
* What authentic, on-the-job tasks or scenarios can we replicate to assess these skills in a realistic context? (e.g., role-playing a client conversation, troubleshooting a simulated system error, analyzing a case study). 15  
* What types of assessments will best measure the learners' understanding and application of the material? (e.g., multiple-choice quizzes for knowledge recall, project-based assignments for application, simulations for skill practice). 15  
* How will we provide feedback to learners on their performance to support their development? 15  
* How will learners have an opportunity to reflect on and self-assess their own learning and progress? 32

### **2.6 Planning for Behavior Transfer & Business Impact**

**Rationale:** The ultimate goal of workplace training is not knowledge acquisition but behavior change that leads to improved business results.35 Learning that occurs in a classroom or an eLearning module is irrelevant unless it is successfully transferred to the job (Kirkpatrick Level 3\) and subsequently impacts organizational goals (Kirkpatrick Level 4). This section includes questions designed to proactively plan for this transfer by identifying potential barriers, establishing support systems, and defining the metrics that will be used to measure on-the-job application and business impact.

* **On-the-Job Behavior (Kirkpatrick Level 3):**  
  * What specific, observable behaviors should we see from learners on the job one month after the training? What do you want people to *start* doing, *stop* doing, or do *differently*? 7  
  * How confident are you that learners will be able to apply what they've learned? What might get in their way? 7  
  * What systems, tools, or processes in the work environment will support the application of these new skills? What might act as a barrier? 15  
  * What role will managers and supervisors play in reinforcing the training? How will they coach and provide feedback on the new behaviors? 15  
  * What resources (e.g., job aids, checklists, expert directories) will learners need post-training to effectively implement what they've learned? 15  
* **Business Impact (Kirkpatrick Level 4):**  
  * Which of the business goals we identified earlier will be most directly affected by these new behaviors? 13  
  * What leading indicators (short-term activity metrics, e.g., "number of new sales plans created using the template") can we track to see if the new behaviors are being adopted? 20  
  * What lagging indicators (long-term business results, e.g., "quarterly sales revenue") will we measure to determine the ultimate impact of the training? 11  
  * How will we collect this data? What systems or reports will we use? 7  
  * Can you provide a specific example of how this training has helped someone achieve positive results in the past? 20

### **2.7 Scoping Logistics, Delivery & Project Parameters**

**Rationale:** This section addresses the practical and operational realities of the training project. Clarifying logistics, timelines, budget, and technology constraints upfront is essential for effective project management. These parameters define the "box" within which the instructional design team must work, influencing decisions about scope, modality, and development resources.

* **Timeline & Milestones:**  
  * What is the desired date for this training to be available to learners? 13  
  * Are there any critical deadlines or milestones for the development process (e.g., content outline review, prototype review, pilot session)? 7  
  * Do learners need to complete this course by a certain date? If so, why? 13  
* **Budget & Resources:**  
  * What is the allocated budget for the design, development, and delivery of this training? 14  
  * What internal resources (e.g., SME time, graphic designers, video producers) are available for this project? 7  
* **Duration & Modality:**  
  * From the learner's perspective, what is the ideal total duration for this learning experience? (e.g., 30 minutes, 4 hours, 3 days). 13  
  * Are there any preferences or constraints regarding the delivery format? (e.g., self-paced eLearning, live virtual classroom, in-person workshop, blended learning, job aid). 14  
  * Will this training be mandatory or elective for the target audience? 14  
* **Technology & Platform:**  
  * Are there any specific technological or platform considerations? (e.g., must be hosted on the company LMS, must be mobile-compatible, must use a specific virtual classroom tool). 15  
  * How will the course be communicated and rolled out to learners? Who is responsible for this communication? 13

### **2.8 Establishing Governance & Lifecycle Management**

**Rationale:** Training content is a valuable organizational asset, but its value diminishes rapidly if it becomes outdated or inaccurate. Proactive governance planning treats learning content not as a one-time project but as a living resource that requires ongoing management. Asking these questions during the initial intake phase establishes clear ownership, defines a maintenance schedule, and ensures the long-term integrity and relevance of the training.

This approach is more than just good housekeeping; it is a critical risk mitigation strategy. In many fields, such as compliance, safety, or regulated industries, outdated training is not merely ineffective—it is a significant liability. Learners acting on obsolete information can lead to compliance violations, safety incidents, legal challenges, and severe reputational damage. By establishing a governance framework from the outset, the L\&D professional helps safeguard the organization against these future risks. This process ensures that a clear owner is assigned, a review cadence is established, and triggers for updates are defined, transforming the training from a static artifact into a reliable and continuously managed source of truth.36

* **Ownership & Maintenance:**  
  * Who will be the designated business owner of this training content after it is launched? Who is ultimately responsible for its accuracy? 38  
  * What is the planned review cycle for this content (e.g., annually, semi-annually)? 36  
  * What events would trigger an immediate review and update of the content (e.g., a change in policy, a new system release, an update to regulations)? 37  
  * What is the formal process for requesting, developing, and approving updates to the course? 38  
* **Review & Approval:**  
  * Who are the key stakeholders and SMEs that must review and approve the course content before it is finalized and launched? 13  
  * How much time will these reviewers need to provide their feedback at each stage of the development process? 13  
* **Versioning & Communication:**  
  * How will different versions of the course be tracked?  
  * When the course is updated, how will learners and their managers be notified of the changes?

## **Part 3: Ready-to-Use Intake Instruments**

Is that correct? Could you tell me more about why this is a priority right now?" 7 | \- "What's the story behind this request?" \- "What happens if we don't solve this problem?" | *Note the business context, urgency, and any recent events that triggered this need.* |  |  |  |
| **5-15 min** | 2\. The Learner's World \- "Let's talk about the learners. Could you walk me through a typical day for someone in?" 15 |  \- "When it comes to this topic, what are their biggest frustrations or challenges?" 23 | \- "What's their current process for handling? Where do they usually get stuck?" | \- "Can you give me a specific example?" \- "What do the top performers do differently from the average performers?" \- "What are their attitudes about this? Are they asking for this training?" | *Capture details about the workflow, environment, pain points, and motivations. Look for the gap between current and desired performance.* |  |
| **15-35 min** | 3\. The "Need-to-Know" Content \- "You mentioned the most critical topics are. Let's focus on the first one. If you were teaching this to a new hire, what's the absolute first thing they need to know?" \- "What's the most common mistake people make right at that step? Why do you think that happens?" 23 |  \- "Can you share a story or a real-world example that brings this concept to life?" 22 |  \- "What information is essential to have memorized vs. what could be looked up in a job aid?" 23 | \- "Walk me through the process step-by-step." \- "What does 'good' look like?" \- "What jargon or acronyms might confuse them?" \- "Are there any 'rules of thumb' or expert tips?" | *Focus on eliciting tacit knowledge: stories, examples, common errors, and expert heuristics. This is the raw material for scenarios and activities.* |  |
| **35-50 min** | 4\. Defining Success: Objectives & Evidence \- "This is great. Now let's get really specific about what learners will be able to do. Let's try to write a few clear learning objectives together." \- "Let's start with a behavior. What action should they be able to perform? (Use Bloom's verb list as a prompt)." 30 |  \- "Under what conditions will they do this? (e.g., 'Given a live customer call...')." 28 |  \- "And how well do they need to do it? What's the minimum standard for success?" 28 |  \- "Now, how can we best test this? What would be a realistic and fair assessment of that objective?" 34 | \- "What would I see or hear that would tell me they've mastered this?" \- "Could we build a simulation or a role-play around that?" \- "What are the key criteria you would use to judge their performance?" | *Collaboratively draft 2-3 core learning objectives in CBC format. Brainstorm authentic assessment ideas for each objective. This is the most critical output of the interview.* |
| **50-55 min** | 5\. Planning for Transfer & Support \- "Once they've completed the training, what needs to happen in the workplace to ensure these new skills stick?" 15 |  \- "What role will managers play? What barriers might learners face when they try to apply this on the job?" 7 | \- "What's one thing we could give them to help them remember this a month from now?" \- "How will their performance be monitored?" | *Identify key support mechanisms and potential barriers to transfer. This informs the design of reinforcement tools and manager communications.* |  |  |
| **55-60 min** | **6\. Wrap-up & Next Steps** \- "This has been incredibly helpful. To summarize, our key objectives are and we'll measure success through." \- "Our next step is to create a detailed design document based on this conversation, which we'll share with you for review by. Is there anything we've missed?" | \- "Who else should we talk to?" \- "Are there any other resources you think we should review?" | *Confirm understanding, clarify next steps, and establish the timeline for the next review cycle.* |  |  |  |

## **Part 4: The Strategic Alignment Mapping Sheet**

This mapping sheet is the capstone document of the intake and discovery process. Its purpose is to create a single, comprehensive view that visually demonstrates the strategic alignment of the entire training program. It serves as a powerful communication tool for stakeholders, a clear blueprint for instructional designers, and a framework for evaluation.

The map operationalizes the "golden thread" concept by linking every component of the learning initiative—from high-level business goals down to specific evaluation metrics—in a logical, cause-and-effect chain. It synthesizes the principles of Backward Design (starting with the end in mind) with the Kirkpatrick Model of evaluation, ensuring that the program is designed from the outset to deliver and demonstrate measurable value.2

### **The Outcome Alignment Map**

**Instructions:** Complete this table collaboratively with the SME and key business stakeholders. Start by defining the Business Outcome in the first column and work your way across to the right, ensuring each column logically flows from the one before it. Use a separate row for each major on-the-job behavior required to achieve the overall business outcome.

| Business Outcome (Kirkpatrick L4/L5) | Required On-the-Job Behaviors (Kirkpatrick L3) | Underlying Competencies (Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes) | Learning Objective (CBC Format & Bloom's Level) | Assessment Method (Acceptable Evidence) | Leading Indicators (Kirkpatrick L1/L2) | Business Impact Metrics (Kirkpatrick L4) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *What is the measurable business goal? What is the desired ROI?* | *What must people DO on the job to achieve this goal? Use observable verbs.* | *What Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSAs) are required to perform the behavior?* | *What will the learner be able to do at the end of the training to demonstrate competence? (Condition-Behavior-Criterion)* | *How will the objective be measured? What is the proof of competence?* | *What short-term metrics will show the training is on track?* | *What final business KPIs will be measured to prove impact?* |
| **Example:** Reduce customer churn rate by 5% in the next 6 months, resulting in a projected $250k revenue retention (ROI). | Proactively identify "at-risk" customers using the new CRM dashboard and correctly apply one of three designated retention plays. | **K:** Features of the new CRM dashboard; criteria for "at-risk" status; details of the 3 retention plays. **S:** Interpreting dashboard data; selecting the appropriate play; executing the play in the CRM. **A:** Ownership of customer success. | **(Applying/Analyzing)** Given a simulated CRM dashboard with 3 distinct customer scenarios \[C\], the learner will correctly identify the at-risk customer and select the most appropriate retention play for all 3 scenarios \[C\]. | Completion of a branching scenario simulation with 100% accuracy on all 3 scenarios. | **L1 (Reaction):** \>90% of learners rate the training as relevant to their job. **L2 (Learning):** \>85% score on a post-course knowledge check about the 3 retention plays. | \- Monthly customer churn rate. \- Number of retention plays logged per rep in CRM. \- Customer satisfaction scores for "at-risk" cohorts. |
| \`\` | \`\` | \`\` | \`\` | \`\` | \[List L1/L2 Metrics\] | \[List L4 Metrics\] |

## **Part 5: Addendum — Tailoring for Gen Z & Gen Alpha Learners**

**Rationale:** While the fundamental principles of learning science apply to all audiences, the preferences for how content is delivered and experienced can vary significantly across generations. Gen Z (born \~1997-2012) and Gen Alpha (born \~2013-present) have grown up as true digital natives, shaping their expectations for learning in the workplace. They often prefer experiences that are personalized, on-demand, interactive, and purpose-driven.39 This addendum provides an optional checklist of questions to discuss with the SME to ensure that design choices are made consciously to engage these learners effectively, without compromising instructional integrity.

### **Optional Design Checklist for Gen Z & Gen Alpha**

Use these questions to prompt a discussion about tailoring the instructional strategy for younger audiences.

**☐ Microlearning & On-Demand Access**

* Can this content be logically broken down into short, self-contained segments (e.g., 2-5 minute videos, interactive modules, or quick-read articles) to fit into a fast-paced workflow? 39  
* How can we make this information easily searchable and accessible at the moment of need, rather than requiring completion of a linear course? 39

**☐ Autonomy & Personalization**

* Can we offer learners choices in how they navigate the content or which activities they complete? 39  
* Are there opportunities to use technology (e.g., adaptive learning platforms, AI-driven recommendations) to create personalized learning paths based on a learner's existing knowledge or role? 39

**☐ Purpose & Value Alignment**

* How can we explicitly connect the training content to a larger purpose or the organization's values and social impact initiatives? 39  
* Can we use testimonials or stories from peers or successful alumni to demonstrate the real-world career benefits of mastering this content? 42

**☐ Interactivity & Media Richness**

* Should this be a "video-first" or "mobile-first" learning experience? 39  
* What opportunities are there to incorporate gamification elements, such as points, badges, or leaderboards, to increase engagement? 41  
* Can we use scenario-based learning or simulations to provide safe, hands-on practice in a realistic context? 41  
* How can we leverage immersive technologies like virtual or augmented reality for complex or high-stakes skills? 39

**☐ Inclusivity & Social Learning**

* How will we ensure that the scenarios, examples, and imagery used in the training reflect a diverse range of identities, perspectives, and experiences? 40  
* Are there opportunities to incorporate social learning, such as peer discussions, collaborative projects, or mentoring, into the experience? 41
