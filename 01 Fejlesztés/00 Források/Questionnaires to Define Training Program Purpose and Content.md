# Questionnaires to Define Training Program Purpose and Content

Developing an effective training program starts with asking the right questions. Before design and development begin, **instructional designers and L\&D professionals gather key information from trainers or subject matter experts (SMEs)** using structured questionnaires or intake interviews. These tools clarify the training’s core purpose, content, audience, and desired outcomes. They help identify **why the training is needed now, what learners should achieve, and what content to include**, ensuring the program aligns with business goals and learner needs. For example, a training intake form might ask, *“What is the organizational need driving this training?”* and *“What should learners do differently as a result of this training?”*[\[1\]](https://learnsfdph.org/wp-content/themes/enfold-child/includes/SFDPH_ProjectIntakeForm_Fillable_062422.pdf#:~:text=Organizational%20Needs%2FInstructional%20Goals%20What%20is,development%20Level%204%3A%20Behavior%20change) – prompting the trainer/SME to articulate the rationale and expected behavior changes. Below are several evidence-informed questionnaires and question sets used in practice, followed by best practices for conducting SME interviews and aligning training requests with measurable learning objectives.

## Sample Pre-Training Questionnaires and Templates

### Training Intake Form Questions (L\&D Stakeholder Survey)

When a department or stakeholder requests a new course, L\&D teams often use an **intake form** to standardize the information gathered. This ensures the **core requirements and context** are captured up front[\[2\]](https://cognota.com/blog/training-request-form-templates/#:~:text=Your%20training%20request%20form%20should,ask%20requesters%20to%20outline)[\[3\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=When%20you%20initially%20meet%20with,away%20with%20the%20following%20information). A typical training request form asks about the **audience, the need for the training, desired outcomes, and logistics**. For example, an intake form might include questions in categories like:

* **Audience (Who):**[\[4\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=Audience%20)

* How many people will complete this training?

* What are the learners’ job functions or levels?

* What prior knowledge or similar training have they experienced?

* **Learning Objectives (What):**[\[5\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=Learning%20Objectives%20)

* What business problem or performance gap is this training intended to address?

* What new skills or knowledge should learners develop to solve that problem?

* What barriers might hinder learners from applying the training effectively?

* **Timing (When):**[\[6\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=Timing%20)

* By when is the training needed (e.g. target launch or deadline)?

* Are there any events or deadlines driving this timeline (e.g. product launch, compliance date)?

* **Delivery (Where/How):**[\[7\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=Delivery%20)

* How will the training be delivered (e.g. in-person, via LMS, webinar)? Any constraints (systems or tools) to consider?

* Will the content require updates or maintenance (if so, how often and by whom)?

* **End Goals (How measured):**[\[8\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=End%20goal%20)[\[9\]](https://cognota.com/blog/training-request-form-templates/#:~:text=,business%20outcomes%20of%20the%20training)

* What will successful performance look like after the training (what should learners be able to do)?

* How will the success of the training be measured (e.g. assessments, on-the-job KPIs, business metrics)?

This intake questionnaire ensures the **“why, who, what, when, where, and how”** are defined at the start. It captures the **purpose of the training, the target audience’s profile, the content scope, and success criteria**[\[10\]](https://blog.elblearning.com/blog/every-elearning-intake-form-needs-include#:~:text=To%20avoid%20creating%20eLearning%20that,all%20of%20your%20eLearning%20projects)[\[2\]](https://cognota.com/blog/training-request-form-templates/#:~:text=Your%20training%20request%20form%20should,ask%20requesters%20to%20outline). By having stakeholders articulate these details, the L\&D team can prioritize requests and start the analysis phase with clear goals in mind.

### SME Content Definition Questions (Initial Course Design Meeting)

In an initial meeting, the instructional designer will often interview the **trainer or SME** to dig deeper into the content and desired outcomes. Andraya M. Goodwin (2021) suggests using a **focused set of questions in the first SME meeting** to ensure the course aligns with the SME’s vision while meeting learner needs[\[11\]](https://elearningindustry.com/questions-ask-your-sme-developing-new-course#:~:text=Summary%3A%20%20As%20Instructional%20Designers%2C,the%20course%20that%20they%20want). For example, key questions to ask the SME include:

1. **Who is the intended audience?** (Learner characteristics and prior knowledge)

2. **What is your overall message or key takeaway?** (If you summed up the training in a sentence or two)

3. **What material or topics do you want to include?** (Scope of content to cover, in what order)

4. **When do you need the project completed by?** (Deadlines or time constraints for development)

5. **When should we schedule our next check-in or review?** (Plan for reviewing a draft or prototype)

6. **Where does this course fit in your department’s goals or programs?** (How it aligns with other trainings or the bigger picture)

7. **Why would the learner need or want to take this training now?** (Learner motivation and the “pain point” the training addresses)

8. **How do you prefer to communicate during the project?** (Communication channels and frequency with the SME)

9. **Where can I find more information on the topic?** (Existing resources, references, or experts to consult)

These questions cover the **audience, key message, content wishes, timeline, context, and resources** in a structured way. They prompt the SME to clarify priorities (“overall message” and must-have content) and context (“why this training matters”), which helps the designer design a course that hits the mark. Notably, asking *“Who is the audience?”* and *“Why does the learner need this?”* ensures the training is **learner-centered and relevant** from the outset. Meanwhile, questions about next steps and communication preferences set the stage for a smooth collaboration[\[12\]](https://elearningindustry.com/questions-ask-your-sme-developing-new-course#:~:text=why%20the%20course%20benefits%20them,directly)[\[13\]](https://elearningindustry.com/questions-ask-your-sme-developing-new-course#:~:text=Don%E2%80%99t%20try%20to%20guess%20and,yourself%2C%20but%20also%20the%20learner). *(Source: Adapted from Goodwin, 2021[\[11\]](https://elearningindustry.com/questions-ask-your-sme-developing-new-course#:~:text=Summary%3A%20%20As%20Instructional%20Designers%2C,the%20course%20that%20they%20want))*

### Comprehensive SME Questionnaire (In-Depth Content & Context)

For more complex projects, L\&D professionals may use an **expanded questionnaire** to thoroughly capture the subject matter. Zaynah Danquah (2023) provides a list of 30 questions for SME interviews, targeting everything from organizational needs to nuanced content details[\[14\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=As%20a%20lead%20instructional%20designer%2C,each%20question%20is%20most%20effective)[\[15\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=share%20a%20comprehensive%20list%20of,each%20question%20is%20most%20effective). Below is a sample of five insightful questions from that comprehensive template:

* **Organizational Need:** *“What challenges will this learning experience help the organization overcome, or what opportunities will it help capitalize on?”*[\[16\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=1,will%20it%20help%20capitalize%20on) (Clarifies the business problem or goal driving the training request.)

* **Learner Pain Points:** *“What are the typical challenges learners face regarding this topic?”*[\[17\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=4,to%20address%20specific%20learner%20difficulties) (Identifies pain points or difficulties the training should address.)

* **Key Takeaways:** *“If learners remember only three things from this training, what should they be?”*[\[18\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=15,Identifying%20the%20most%20crucial%20takeaways) (Helps the SME pinpoint the **most crucial learning outcomes** or messages.)

* **On-the-Job Application:** *“How can this content be applied to on-the-job performance?”*[\[19\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=1,the%20content%20practical%20and%20relevant) (Focuses on **practical relevance**, ensuring the training leads to real-world performance improvement.)

* **Measuring Understanding:** *“How would you assess the understanding of this topic?”*[\[20\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=6,effective%20assessments%20or%20knowledge%20checks) (Gathers the SME’s ideas on evaluating learners – e.g. quizzes, demos – and aligns with how **success will be demonstrated**.)

These kinds of questions encourage the SME to share **examples, critical incidents, common mistakes, and must-know vs. nice-to-know content**. For instance, asking about common learner mistakes or “dangerous errors” in the topic can highlight content that needs extra emphasis in training. Likewise, asking for stories or real scenarios can enrich the course material. Using a comprehensive questionnaire ensures no key insight is missed during the analysis phase; however, it can be time-consuming, so designers often tailor the depth of questioning to the project’s complexity. *(Source: 24/7 Teach – Danquah, 2023[\[16\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=1,will%20it%20help%20capitalize%20on)[\[21\]](https://247teach.org/blog-for-instructional-design/mastering-sme-interviews-top-30-questions-for-effective-elearning-content-development#:~:text=14,potential%20learner%20objections%20or%20concerns))*

## Best Practices for Conducting Trainer/SME Intake Interviews

Gathering information via questionnaires or interviews isn’t just about the questions – **how** you conduct the process is crucial. Experts recommend the following best practices to get the most value from trainer/SME interviews:

* **Prepare Thoroughly:** Do your homework before the interview. Understand the high-level **performance gap or problem** the training aims to solve and review any existing documentation[\[22\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=,greatly%20appreciated%20when%20you%20don%E2%80%99t). Being somewhat informed enables you to ask sharper questions and keep the conversation focused. Prepare your question list in advance and, if possible, share the agenda with the SME so they can also come prepared.

* **Build Rapport and Respect Time:** Acknowledge that the SME or trainer is likely busy and thank them for their time[\[23\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=,order%20to%20perform%20the%20task%3F%E2%80%9D). Start by clarifying the interview’s purpose and what you hope to accomplish. This sets a cooperative tone. If appropriate, ask for permission to record the discussion for later reference (in addition to taking detailed notes). Recording ensures you don’t miss details and lets you **actively listen** instead of frantically scribbling[\[24\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=these%20or%20do%20research%20on,or%20understanding%20to%20the%20SME)[\[25\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=,to%20minimize%20information%E2%80%94they%20know%20so).

* **Narrow the Focus to Objectives:** During the interview, **steer the conversation toward the specific skills, knowledge, and behaviors** the training needs to address[\[26\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=,order%20to%20perform%20the%20task%3F%E2%80%9D). Subject matter experts possess a deep reservoir of knowledge and may stray into interesting but non-essential tangents. Politely ask clarifying questions like, *“Is this detail something the learner* *must* *know to perform the task?”* to distinguish between need-to-know content and extraneous nice-to-know info[\[26\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=,order%20to%20perform%20the%20task%3F%E2%80%9D). This keeps the session on track and centered on achieving the learning objectives.

* **Use Probing and Follow-Up Questions:** Don’t hesitate to drill down for clarity. If an SME mentions a process or tool, ask for examples or common pitfalls. Encourage them to draw diagrams or show workflows if it helps illustrate complex content[\[27\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=,be%20an%20obstacle%20to%20learning)[\[28\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=track.%20,with%20summary%20emails%20for%20approval). Paraphrase and summarize what you hear (*“So the key steps are X, Y, Z, correct?”*) to check your understanding and let the SME validate or correct your interpretation[\[29\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=getting%20a%20brain%20dump.%20,most%20effective%20for%20explaining%20abstract).

* **Capture and Organize Information:** Take detailed notes and note any gaps or follow-ups needed. Directly after the meeting, **review and organize your notes** while the information is fresh[\[30\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=Phase%203%3A%20Follow). It’s wise to send a brief summary email to the SME outlining your understanding of the objectives, content, and next steps, to confirm alignment. This follow-up not only verifies accuracy but also builds trust that you value the SME’s input.

* **Establish Next Steps:** Before closing, agree on how you will continue working together. Set expectations for how the SME will review draft materials or provide additional content. Also, decide on communication preferences (email, weekly calls, etc.) and reasonable turnaround times for feedback[\[12\]](https://elearningindustry.com/questions-ask-your-sme-developing-new-course#:~:text=why%20the%20course%20benefits%20them,directly)[\[31\]](https://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/subject-matter-experts/#:~:text=concepts.%20,with%20summary%20emails%20for%20approval). Clear communication channels and roles prevent misunderstandings and keep the development process running smoothly.

By following these practices, instructional designers can make the SME interview process efficient and insightful. Good preparation and active listening yield richer information, while professional courtesy and clarity pave the way for a strong ongoing collaboration.

## Aligning Training Content with Measurable Objectives

One common challenge is ensuring that **what a trainer wants to teach is aligned to specific, measurable learning objectives**. Trainers/SMEs may initially think in terms of topics or content they’re passionate about, but the instructional designer’s job is to translate that into **concrete outcomes** for learners. Here are some tips for achieving this alignment:

* **Start with the End in Mind:** Begin discussions by defining the **learning objectives and outcomes**. Ask the trainer, *“What should learners be able to do by the end of this training?”* This shifts the focus from simply covering content to achieving outcomes. Make sure objectives are stated in **actionable, observable terms**, not abstractions. For instance, “Understand project management” is vague, whereas “Execute the 5 stages of project management by creating a sample project plan” is specific and measurable. Using frameworks like **SMART criteria or Bloom’s Taxonomy** can help in formulating clear objectives[\[32\]](https://babbeducation.com/blog/7-best-practices-for-instructional-designers-working-with-subject-matter-experts#:~:text=Key%20Strategies%3A). Encourage the SME to prioritize the most important skills or behaviors rather than an exhaustive list[\[33\]](https://babbeducation.com/blog/7-best-practices-for-instructional-designers-working-with-subject-matter-experts#:~:text=,much%20content%20can%20hinder%20learning).

* **Connect to Business Goals and Metrics:** Frame the conversation around the problem the training is supposed to solve. If the training is truly needed, it’s because it addresses a business need or performance gap. Pin down that need (e.g. “reduce error rates in manufacturing by 20%” or “improve customer satisfaction scores”). Then ensure each learning objective can link to that need. Likewise, determine upfront **how success will be measured** – for example, through on-the-job performance indicators or assessment results[\[9\]](https://cognota.com/blog/training-request-form-templates/#:~:text=,business%20outcomes%20of%20the%20training). By asking in the intake, *“How will we know the training is successful?”*, you prompt stakeholders to think in terms of measurable results[\[34\]](https://www.learningguild.com/articles/marc-my-words-ask-10-questions-before-starting-instructional-design#:~:text=4,the%20training%20is%20successful)[\[35\]](https://cognota.com/blog/training-request-form-templates/#:~:text=,business%20outcomes%20of%20the%20training). This alignment guarantees that the content the trainer provides is relevant to achieving those results.

* **Focus and Filter Content:** Often, SMEs have a **wealth of knowledge** and may be inclined to include as much as possible. It’s important to filter content against the objectives. During the intake, map each proposed topic or module to a specific objective or outcome. If something doesn’t clearly support an objective, consider placing it in a “nice-to-know” category or omitting it. As Jennifer Levy notes, *“SMEs may be eager to share as much content as possible… instructional designers need to help SMEs focus on what learners* *need* *to learn to meet the course objectives,”* aligning content with **specific, measurable outcomes**[\[36\]](https://babbeducation.com/blog/7-best-practices-for-instructional-designers-working-with-subject-matter-experts#:~:text=SMEs%20often%20have%20a%20wealth,with%20specific%2C%20measurable%20learning%20outcomes). Remind the trainer that **depth of understanding** on key points is more valuable than superficial coverage of too many topics. This often means making tough choices about what *not* to include, guided by the question: *“Does this directly support the learning objectives?”*

* **Make Objectives Observable and Attainable:** For each learning point the trainer wants to teach, determine how a learner could **demonstrate mastery**. This ties back into writing measurable objectives (using action verbs like *define, troubleshoot, design, etc.*). It also helps in designing the right assessments later. If a trainer says they want to teach a concept, ask, *“What would it look like for the learner to prove they learned that? Can we simulate it or test it?”* This ensures the objective is not only clear but also feasible to evaluate. It also sometimes reveals if a proposed topic is too abstract or broad, prompting a refinement of scope. In the end, aligning content with measurable objectives means the training is set up to produce **documentable outcomes**, making it easier to evaluate effectiveness (e.g. via Kirkpatrick’s levels for reaction, learning, behavior change, and results).

By aligning the trainer’s expertise and wishes with well-defined learning objectives, you create a roadmap for the training that satisfies both the **SME’s intent and the organization’s needs**. This alignment phase ensures that the final training program isn’t just a collection of interesting content, but a targeted learning experience designed to change behavior or improve performance in ways that can be observed and measured[\[37\]](https://babbeducation.com/blog/7-best-practices-for-instructional-designers-working-with-subject-matter-experts#:~:text=,much%20content%20can%20hinder%20learning)[\[9\]](https://cognota.com/blog/training-request-form-templates/#:~:text=,business%20outcomes%20of%20the%20training). In practice, this might involve iterative negotiation with the SME – but investing that effort upfront leads to a stronger, more purposeful training program.
